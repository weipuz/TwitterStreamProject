Before start, you need install sbt(simple build tool) to build the source code. Iâ€™m using set 0.13.8 and scala version 2.10.4. 
The pre build version is over 5MB and cannot be uploaded. Please email me for any question.

1. Go to the root folder which contains the build.sbt file, run:
	sbt assembly
to build a fat jar which contains all necessary library including the twitter utility.  
Please modify the version in build.sbt to fit your spark version. 
Also noted that the file hierarchy in the folder need to main unchanged. Or, to be specifically, the must be a file named assembly.sbt under project folder, and the source file must under src/main/scala/***.scala


2. command to submit the spark streaming application:

spark-submit --class org.apache.spark.examples.streaming.TwitterCount --master local[4] target/scala-2.10/TwitterCount-assembly-1.0.jar <consumer key> <consumer secret> <access token> <access token secret> 

3. command to check the MySQL data:
./scala -classpath "target/scala-2.10/TwitterCount-assembly-1.0.jar" org.apache.spark.examples.streaming.ScalaJdbcConnectSelect
